        First, group cells into clusters with FlowSOM using self-organizing map clustering and minimal spanning trees, and subsequently perform meta-clustering with ConsensusClusterPlus which determines cluster count and membership by stability evidence.<br>
        A self-organizing map (SOM) is an artificial neural network that reflects the topological information of the input in lower dimensions.<br>
        Meta clustering is carried out based on a consensus hierarchical method. By re-sampling from the original data and clustering the samples, an agreement value between the perturbations is obtained which leads to meta clusters in a hierarchical structure. The number of meta clusters is manually chosen based on the cumulative distribution function curves, the relative changes in area under these cdfs and the proportion of ambiguous clusters. (Clustering Output, Section 1. Metaclustering Analysis)<br>
        This clustering approach is fast and performs better than comparable techniques <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href = https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.23030>Weber et al. (2016)</a>."
